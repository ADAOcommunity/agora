The governor is a simpler component than others in the system but still provides an invaluable role.

### Governor responsibilities

The governor acts as the central authority through which all governance proceeds indirectly. You can think of it as the single point for issuing rights to actors.

#### Minting of authority tokens

The main responsibility for the governor is allowing the minting of [authority tokens](authority-tokens.md), and ensuring they are sent to [effects](effects.md). The governor needs to check that this happens as a result of a proposal finishing its voting phase.

#### Guarding creation of proposals

The governor is also responsible for allowing the _creation_ of proposals. There are a few rules for the creation of a proposal, and the governor ensures these rules are followed.

In order for proposals to have sequential IDs, the governor keeps track of a counter which it uses to ensure an ID has not been taken yet. The governor also needs to keep global settings that influence how proposals behave: thresholds for state transitions, how long each phase lasts, etc.

The governor, in-line with other Agora components, allows its state to be mutated, subject to the burning of an authority token.
